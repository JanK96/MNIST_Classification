# Classification of MNIST Dataset Handwritten Digits with Convolutional Neural Network and User Interface

- project to classify handwritten digits using a convolutional neural network
- dataset is the MNIST handwritten digit database
- network is created with Pytorch and can be trained with different parameters
- evaluation is done with sklearn
- a pygame window was used to generate new input to the CNN
